# Front End App to Sprotts' Closed End Funds

The purpose of the app is to visualize data which was gathered from
the back end app. Here, I try to combine my knowledge of Vue and
plotly with its superior graphing capabilities. 

Though the integration of Vue and Plotly isn't trivial I'm giving it a shot.


## Setup

cd into the frontend directory where this README should be located.

    npm install

Start the backend. See the README of the backend for details.

When the backend is running, you can start the development server using

    npm run dev

## Development

Before committing run:

    npm run lint

After fixing the errors run the formatter:

    npm run format

## Tests

The front end app is not covered with tests yet.
